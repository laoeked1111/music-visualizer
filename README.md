# music-visualizer

This is a music visualizer made using Python. It takes the STFT of a tune and displays the plot in real-time. It can also display a spectrogram of the tune.

## Usage

Running `main.py` starts the program. Enter the name of the sound file. It should be formatted like `file.wav`. When prompted, select one of the options for which tune to use (for stereo signals) and whether or not to show a spectrogram.
